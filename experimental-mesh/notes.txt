we will implement a unique network. We will leverage bluezelle nodes as "routers" that service 100 peer swarms.
 we will used hashed usernames to identify messages. 

MILESTONE 1)
 send out message with hashed username/GUID, and have server recieve it, mark them as "active in the swarm" and append them to a table along with groups they are associated with.

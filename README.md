>>ScryP2P is a decentralized p2p encrypted messenger for web 3.0

Our project is future focused, providing a decentralized messaging platform using blockchain and next gen DAPP technologies.

Many modern encryptino techniques are employed to keep our project VERY heavilly encrypted with multiple failsafes.

Due to the modern encryption schemes employed (ECC with ECDSA SIGNING, and Salsa 20) we ae able to be VERY performant, 

even on modest hardware to ensure accessibility to all, Regardless of economic status, because free speech without fear is a human right.

This is a DAPP employed using Bluezelle's next generation tech for the web 3.0. 

DECENTRALIZE ALL THE THINGS!!
